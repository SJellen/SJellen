# Scott Jellen  
### Independent Researcher · Systems Thinking · Protocol Design

I explore how sports, media, and digital systems can be structured more cleanly through **interoperability**, **rights modeling**, and **protocol-oriented design**.

My work is early-stage but focused on building **coherent, well-documented artifacts** rather than producing volume. Everything here is iterative, transparent, and meant to improve over time.

## 📡 Current Work: Universal Sports Graph (USG)

USG is an ongoing experiment in treating sports broadcast rights as structured data.

**What exists today:**
- A **Blueprint whitepaper** (DOI-backed)
- **RFC 0001** (initial protocol draft)
- Early **JSON schemas** (event, entitlement, settlement)
- A developing **protocols repo** with examples and diagrams

**What is planned but not yet built:**
- Additional RFCs
- A simple registry
- A reference API or SDK

I keep expectations realistic: this is exploratory research, not a standard.  
All documents are published early, in-progress, and subject to revision.

## 📚 Whitepapers

I write conceptual papers about systems, institutions, and platform design.  
Not all are “blueprint-level”; many are simply structured thinking.

**Completed / Published:**
- **The Universal Sports Graph — Blueprint Edition**  
- **The Sports Spin-Off**  
- **The Hybrid Season**  
- **The Fourth Act**  
- **The $1,000 Problem / $750 Solution**  
- **The Shadow Subscription**  
- **The Content Layer**  
- **Minimum Viable Classroom**  
- **Less Than Net Zero**  
- **AEEA (Artificial Enhanced Experience Advertising)**

## 📝 Briefs (Early Drafts)

Shorter summaries or exploratory notes based on my longer work.  
Most are work-in-progress and published when they feel useful.

## 🔧 Software Work

While most of my current focus is research, I still build front-end prototypes to test ideas.

Some public projects include:
- Media Tracker (React)
- Screening (entertainment discovery tool)
- Harvard Art Explorer
- General Knowledge (quiz platform)

These are straightforward builds that reflect my front-end background.

## 🧭 Approach

My research is guided by:
- clarity over scale  
- documentation over speed  
- strong versioning and transparency  
- publishing early rather than waiting for “perfect”

I’m not trying to be a think tank or a company.  
This is simply an **independent research practice** focused on systems that interest me.
