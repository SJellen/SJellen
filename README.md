### Independent Researcher · Protocol Design · Rights Modeling

I study how rights, incentives, and system architecture can be represented clearly through **standards-style protocols**, **schemas**, and **reference models**.

This profile serves as an **index and entry point** for my protocol-oriented research, including RFC-style specifications, schema drafts, registry artifacts, and supporting reference tools.

Primary development and canonical artifacts are maintained in the `SJellen/protocols` repository, with transparent versioning and explicit scope.

## 📡 Flagship Work: Universal Sports Graph (USG)

The **Universal Sports Graph (USG)** is an emerging protocol for representing sports broadcast rights as structured, interoperable data.

USG defines a neutral, machine-readable layer for:
- rights registration  
- access authorization  
- settlement and auditability  

The goal is to clarify incentives across leagues, platforms, distributors, and audiences by making rights computable.

### Published Artifacts
- **The Universal Sports Graph — Blueprint Edition** (DOI-backed whitepaper)  
- **RFC 0001 — The Universal Sports Graph**  
  Core rights graph, access surface, and clearinghouse model.
- **RFC 0002 — USG Entitlement Token Profile**  
  Standards-track specification defining tokenized access, required claims, validation rules, security properties, and interoperability expectations.
- **RFC 0003 — USG Registry Architecture**  
  Standards-track specification defining canonical registry object models, identifier semantics, lifecycle rules, canonical JSON and digest requirements, index structures, federation rules, and validation requirements.

Together, RFCs 0001–0003 define the **minimum viable USG protocol stack**:  
**rights graph → access enforcement → authoritative data substrate**.

### Schemas & Reference Artifacts
- Registry object schemas  
- Event, league, team, venue, broadcaster, and rights-bundle definitions  
- Entitlement token and settlement record schemas  
- Deterministic index files and registry metadata  
- Validation and integrity-check tooling (illustrative, non-production)

### In Development
- Governance and compliance RFCs  
- Settlement and clearinghouse extensions  
- Registry federation and multi-authority models  
- Reference implementations and validation tooling

## 🧭 Research Approach

- clarity over scale  
- versioning over polish  
- publish early, refine in public  
- treat systems as structures: **rights → access → incentives → outcomes**
