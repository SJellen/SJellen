## üëã About Me

I'm a software developer with a systems mindset focused on building interfaces that are **performant**, **accessible**, and **designed to scale**.  

I work with **React**, **Next.js**, **Vite**, and modern design systems to create responsive, maintainable web apps. I prioritize clarity ‚Äî in code, in user experience, and in architecture ‚Äî because small technical decisions shape long-term resilience.

Beyond code, I explore how industries, platforms, and institutions evolve. I've authored strategic whitepapers proposing frameworks for college sports, league formats, AI-powered media, mobility platforms, and advertising systems.
