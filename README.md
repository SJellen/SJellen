# Scott Jellen  
### Independent Researcher · Systems Thinking · Protocol Design

I explore how complex systems — in sports, media, mobility, education, and digital infrastructure — can be redesigned through **interoperability**, **rights modeling**, and **protocol-oriented architecture**.

This repository is the home for my RFCs, schemas, drafts, and reference artifacts.  
My work is early-stage but focused on building **coherent, well-documented artifacts** with clear versioning and transparent iteration.

## 📡 Current Work: Universal Sports Graph (USG)

USG is a **new protocol** for treating sports broadcast rights as structured, interoperable data.

**What exists today:**
- A **Blueprint whitepaper** (DOI-backed)  
- **RFC 0001** (initial protocol draft)  
- Early **JSON schemas** (event, entitlement, settlement)  
- A developing **protocols repo** with examples and diagrams  

**What is planned but not yet built:**
- Additional RFCs  
- A lightweight registry  
- A reference API or SDK  

All documents are published early, in-progress, and subject to revision (v0.x).

## 📚 Whitepapers

I write conceptual papers about systems, institutions, and platform design.  
Some are blueprint-level; others are structured thinking meant to surface new models.

**Completed / Published:**
- **The Universal Sports Graph — Blueprint Edition**  
- **The Sports Spin-Off**  
- **The Hybrid Season**  
- **The Fourth Act**  
- **The $1,000 Problem / $750 Solution**  
- **The Shadow Subscription**  
- **The Content Layer**  
- **Minimum Viable Classroom**  
- **Less Than Net Zero**  
- **AEEA (Artificial Enhanced Experience Advertising)**

## 📝 Briefs (Early Drafts)

Shorter, decision-ready documents derived from my longer work.  
Published when they feel useful, not when they feel finished.

## 🔧 Software Work

While my focus is research, I prototype interfaces and tools as needed.

Some public builds:
- Media Tracker (React)  
- Screening (entertainment discovery tool)  
- Harvard Art Explorer  
- General Knowledge (quiz platform)  

These reflect my front-end background and help test ideas.

## 🧭 Approach

Guiding principles:
- clarity over scale  
- documentation over speed  
- strong versioning and transparency  
- publish early rather than wait for “perfect”
