### Independent Researcher · Protocol Design · Rights Modeling

I study how rights, incentives, and system architecture can be represented clearly through **standards-style protocols**, **schemas**, and **reference models**.

This repository is the **canonical working tree** for my protocol-oriented research, including RFC-style specifications, schema drafts, registry artifacts, and supporting examples.  
All work is early-stage, exploratory, and published with transparent versioning.

## 📡 Flagship Work: Universal Sports Graph (USG)

The **Universal Sports Graph (USG)** is an emerging protocol for representing sports broadcast rights as structured, interoperable data.

USG defines a neutral, machine-readable layer for:
- rights registration  
- access authorization  
- settlement and auditability  

It is designed to clarify incentives across leagues, platforms, distributors, and audiences.

### Published Artifacts
- **The Universal Sports Graph — Blueprint Edition** (DOI-backed whitepaper)  
- **RFC 0001 — The Universal Sports Graph**  
  Defines the core rights graph, access surface, and clearinghouse concept.
- **RFC 0002 — USG Entitlement Token Profile**  
  Standards-track specification defining tokenized access, required claims, validation rules, security properties, and interoperability expectations.

### Schemas & Reference Artifacts
- Event schema  
- Entitlement token schema  
- Settlement record schema  
- Early diagrams (protocol stack, flows, validation paths)

### In Development
- **RFC 0003+** (registry architecture, governance, settlement, compliance)  
- Registry layer (object validation, lifecycle rules, semantic constraints)  
- Reference implementation sketches (non-production)  
- Expanded governance, audit, and policy alignment models

## 🗂 Registry & Protocol Direction

The registry layer formalizes **authoritative identifiers**, **object semantics**, and **validation rules** for USG-compliant data.

Rather than serving as a simple index, the registry is intended to function as a **reference substrate**:
- enforcing stable identifiers  
- preventing semantic drift  
- supporting auditability and downstream interoperability  

This layer is evolving alongside the RFC series.

## 📝 Briefs

Concise research briefs derived from larger papers and protocol work.  
Intended to clarify structure, incentives, or implementation patterns without full specification weight.

## 🧭 Research Approach

- clarity over scale  
- versioning over polish  
- publish early, refine in public  
- treat systems as structures: **rights → access → incentives → outcomes**
