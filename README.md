# Scott Jellen  
### Independent Researcher · Protocol Design · Rights Modeling

I study how rights, incentives, and system architecture can be represented more clearly through **standards-style models**, **schemas**, and **protocol-oriented design**.

This repository contains my RFC-style documents, schema drafts, examples, and reference artifacts.  
The work is early-stage, exploratory, and published with transparent versioning.

## 📡 Current Work: Universal Sports Graph (USG)

USG is an **emerging protocol** for representing sports broadcast rights as structured, interoperable data.

**Currently available:**
- Blueprint whitepaper (DOI-backed)  
- **RFC 0001** — initial protocol draft  
- Early JSON schemas (event, entitlement, settlement)  
- Initial diagrams and examples  

**In development:**
- Additional RFCs  
- Registry concepts  
- Reference implementation sketches

## 🧭 Research Approach

- clarity over scale  
- versioning over polish  
- publish early, refine over time  
- treat systems as structures: rights → access → incentives → outcomes
